# Exploring-Regression-Modeling
This is a project for my Machine Learning/AI Certification Course. The project is semi-guided in analyzing a dataset concerning car pricing using more advanced regression techniques.
In this project, I use the CRISP-DM framework to guide my analysis of a dataset of used cars. My analysis leads to the creation of a number of models and optimization of hyperparameters. The analysis shows a strong bias toward the manufacturer of the car, but my models suffer from what I believe to be overfitting, so the results may not be accurate.
